# vimv2

vimv2 is [vi-mv](https://github.com/thameera/vimv)-2, not vim-v2.

## Installation

```sh
go install mtoohey.com/vimv2@latest
```

## Usage

While `cd`'d into the directory in which you want to rename files, run `vimv2` with no arguments.

## Improvements

- Duplicate filename checks
- Overwriting collision checks ([vimv#38](https://github.com/thameera/vimv/issues/38), [vimv#39](https://github.com/thameera/vimv/issues/39))
